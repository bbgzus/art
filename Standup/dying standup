taboo subject: death

hey relax, it's going to happen!

is death our god?

i mean, if he can spare my life...

i mean if there is actually a guy

that comes for ya in the end

that sounds like god

that's what mormonism is kinda

like a police officer

imagine, fast and furious

you were the bad guy

bank robber

oceans 11

oh hey

buddy, 

yeah

ticket

hell

wha??!!!

crowd cheering for him as he passes

like christ to the cross

where those he healed

did very little

said even less of their loss

lost

forgotten

dead

well that turned dark ;)

i do my best thinking & writing

when thinking of sleeping and dying
