when i was just a baby boy my momma used to tell we these crazy things 
like about two wizards, one the form of lizard, eternally batteling
then i got a little bit older and i realized the crazy didn't stop there 
then one fateful day, i took some special k, and for what i saw man i wasn't prepared

-- rap --

they say in not really rappin bout god no more

wait, i'm all mixed up is this belial or thor?

what? slut, beast oops, i mean whore

remind them the lion will find and fuck'n settle the score

what is loki-for? luci-for? The master of chaos?

in his image he made us, there's no way you can dismay us 

oh wait, cain killed his own brother

abraham to sacrifice his son & you want us to trust & love each other?

see this beat is in similitude to eminem

i'm a white rapper, so eventually ill be compared to him, HEY SLIM!

Hi my name is -SHH, I can't tell you

I made an oath in a temple that i'm still bound to

so i put my hands up when I pray to you

but it's not true u require tokens & signs now... do you?

oh, now he's revealin free mason secrets

like the signs for angelic front lines, and when he cut ties he didn't wanna keep it!?

while on the subject, i learned his secret names

got a library of occult & holy books & read every page.

its no mystery, just look @ the history 

like a page from the mage of the elizabethan age

John Dee. could it be? reincarnate

witin rhymes to pass the time & formatin magic

extend the reach of what i precich that's tech go-go-gadgit 

not talkin that rabbit auta hat bit more like alice & mad hat kid

look, saying crazy like BAT SHIT

now is it crazy insane, or insane crazy

they ask who sane? and i say J D

see J C remade me, i'm a truama baby

scitzo disciple or yogi maybe

say it clear as i can halleluyiah - praise be

-- sing --

that include legion? hmmm... with that i'll leave it be

Shh!
