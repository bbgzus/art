if you were to ask me what it was all about
there'd be details I'd have to leave out

still wanna know what I'm talking about
lend an ear, let me help ya out

see up in heaven we got massive clout
except for the fact that they cast us out
maybe because we branched out
agreed with he that had a doubt

so we promised to keep our mouths shut
elohim yeah that's whats up

got gods and demons sayin what the fuck
man i swear this all feels like a cover up

what a bitter cup 
that everything's corrupt
so he doubled up
and raised him up
till he come's on up
and runs amouk

that's apocolyptic not criptic
beloved, trusted, vision, gifted

in the bible shits' written
still don't, think that, yall, get it

so i channel spirit and spit it
eyes to see, and ears to hear it
await the day, i do not fear it
if confusion then let me clear it

talking jeovha, 
oh my god
lion of judda
got blood oaths & holy ghost
mantras and mudras

now i don't want to be a nusance
cause i know we already been through thus
and i aint gonna dismiss judas' kiss

but if you were to ask me what it was all about?
there'd be details I'd have to leave out
