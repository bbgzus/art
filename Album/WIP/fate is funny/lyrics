just trying to make sense of all the tragedy
that has behapend me

not surprised to see
that fate thinks itself funny

past lives
ex wives
bad tribes
eternal tribes

all a joke
a dream until woke
mirrors and smoke

funny right?

fate seems to be silly

he won't just kill me

other plans made

outfits fit frilly 

who knows "gilly"

a few truths internally wanna drill me

but fate is funny

maybe he just do it all for the money

like judas

cruxifixate us

like mudras

thumgs and index finger touch

sutras & dutas

duty - if fate would just shoot me

but he's seen it all, don't like that movie

thinks more in jokes now you see

fucking fate master of comedy

comedy of errors

night terrors turned good bank errors

or emergency flares

or "you wouldn't dares"

do temptin

approach you with a grin

he knows he wins

fate is funnily trustin

would you stay?

is fate to blame?

would it be the same?

am i insane?

is life a game?

who is this dame?

never the same

i was never the same

i remember when we passed away

before the divorce of course

not your white horse

buyers remorse

just stay due course
