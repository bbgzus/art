(to the wrong ones)

power of goodbyes
deep cries
building statues 
from bread ties
white lies
of a grand prize
look to the skies
and realize

its over
now sit
behold her
that shoulder
lord over
in that new range rover

there is a power in goodbyes
reset of priority
god above all
no seniorirty
authority
others not controlling me

a death by a thousand cuts
a whos is who is whats is whats
a ya know ya whats
a doctrinal struct
construct
abstruct
dealing out imprissionment
guiltridinit
an shiddidit
or shouldn't it
now cant quit it
a heretic
let's not even talk semetic
cause i meant it
i wont forget it
cause it changed me
deranged me
so here's to the wrong ones

the wrong ones
we had the wrong ones (with guilt in voice)
the power of goodbyes
is in saying goodbyes
to the wrong ones
to the wrong ones
the half dones
the crazy crumbs
the jump up and obstructums
stop you from reaching all that you can ones

(spacing event & important)

good bye

let by gones be by gones
and sad songs sad songs

fair well

who cares

dumb stares

good bye ( gross -- discondtentednessfwith - pitiful )
