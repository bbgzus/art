its never enough
to be buff
left in a slump
got a few humps
so what
shoulder shrug
no hug
nothing
still something
oh dear
still here
why fear
when dreams are near
cause i can't touchem
dont even mention
feels like forever detention
the things we do and dont mention
hypertension
hyperventalation
duration
curation
this station

trying to breathe in death
he's the only opponent i have left
death
even satan
can't escape his fatin
death is waitin
for all
not playin

oh wait....
what was christ sayin?

rich and sad
sell all you have

life is nothing
a flame so easily snuffin
death doesn't come bluffin
outlive & outwit
out bodies can't handleit
so the molecules dismantle it

death
enough
life is tuff
shit can get rough
suffering is truth
buddha like so what
let's eat
roll up
restaurant row with a couple hundred bucks
tonight it all on us
so what
death huh
a tomb
empty room
eventual doom
enough
