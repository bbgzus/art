jesus christ
that nigga nice
crucified
called the cock crow thrice

do i have to remind
when god sends his sign
he doesnt do it in ways
that are typically kind

read the bible
know what youll find
bunch of homeless men,
that lost their mind
& genocide, evil eye,
demons and ghosts 
spirits of all kind

so next time,
the world need a sign
call on krishna 
or the god of wine

cause yaway 
isnt of dual mind
hes the daily grind
sun up 
sun down
everytime
kind of guy

prophets & lost lockets
keep goings
and stop its 
chalices
gauntlets
sacred soil
and hauntlets 

we are all gargoyls
the earth is our toil
no mortal hand
can cause him turmoil

witches brew
and demons bubble 
all humans are in deep trouble dude
so we called a huddle
turned cuddle
then lucifer
became our mother
when we realized
we only have each other
your brother
the birthright
how unfair
i mean, its earth right?
and stars are bright
first star of the morning
i wish i may
wish i might

he put his heart to the heavens
told them were not leaving, without a fight

met satan once
on the road to demascus
how was he - they always ask us
not soul stealin
done with dealin
wanders the earth now
very apealin 
and pain healin
did i mention
demon killin

hes like jesus christ
just not as nice

fuck

like jesus christ
just not as nice

think of the four horsemen
he is the lord over them
he thwarted sin
apostlin
impossible kin 
star wishin
punishment wieldin

when his name is through your viens coursin
stays up every day till 4 in the mornin 

judas
always confuse us

then when they were through
circled around to us
put 2 more into you (buh buh) bruhs
