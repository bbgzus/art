first shall be last
the last shall be first

should have seen me trying where to put this verse
is this the curse?
the one where I try to reverse
but find out either path I choose
imposible to tell which is worse?

i giveup 
just wanna live up
to what i'm rid of
lost it all - stickup
happend again - can't make this shit up
make me what to just give up
the ghost give up
tear out your rib slut

so what?

the sun also rises

no surprises

don[t] trust a man with no vices

what're your demises?

---------

that's karma right?

past mes had tragic apetites

blood rites

full moon nights

who knows their plight

i just got this life right

karma cuaght up to me

wrote a blank check

asked me where to i wanted it deposited see

and all i could think is woe is me

think of the hypocrisy

that truth bring

the reprcousin

of a bad cousin fuckin

with what they shouldn't

or couldn't

handle on their own

guns being drawn in homes

good nights to broken in domes

sometimes warriors don't come home

safety is a savior i've never known

warrior born

first

cursed

versed

i just put a name to it
hey yoiu'd do the same to it
if you could see through it
samsaric bullshit
cycle
micheal
azaeal
bezelbub
the christ in us
departus
or thwart us
judge us
above us
none so ispectous
so the first turned rebelious
they say god is jealous
the first shall be last
how destructive of us

pearls to swine
the god of wine
turned back time
and all we do is whine
commit crime
sit back in PR
and think shit is fine
there's a hurricane coming
well maybe for you
i like storms just fine

born in the darkness
relate to an abysss
not just some hex
can't lift this
it's a depth propostourous
hip hop a opponmous
anonyomous
monstrosotous
all of this

fist light of the morning
sun god
raw thoth
hypnotous
do unto him not us
deliver us from satanous

the rebeliouhs
rebels have rebels
demonic choir chose not to sing the trebels
stayed low then deliverd a blow
who thought he was in charge of thus
ancenstrous
don't mess with us
first things first
learn your lessons
know you can't trust

no trust
all is lust
do what you must
pity for those who covet us
first
born
first
torn
first
sworn
first
adjorned
first
curesed & gorn
first 
so what
first
so what 
first
i thirst
cursed
