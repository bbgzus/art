some say im synonymous with diogenes

philosophical with a magic twist

just glad ya'll could witness
- - - - - pounds
sit back & marvel at this conjured bliss

- normal beat

like a waxing moon before full bloom

won't say i'm on top that'd be too soon

if ya see me on the outs then come through

fixin'a have marble counter tops in my guest room

while on the subject of marbles 

yeah i lost a few

few like me too 

we solid dudes

i don't mind those few with screws loose

the counter culture and obtuse

this goes out to the people in psych wards

the tweaker, vato & drug lords

in this life man we of all accords

and this is where typically would go the chorus like duh duh duh du

but i'm off course

life is too short

so put my money where my mouse was and got divorced

preach a gospel of vengeance with no remorse

that's apocalypse son, now where's my sickle and horse
