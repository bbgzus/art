in case of capture
realize you've been caught
the system, in its wisdom
didn't like being fought

will it treat your case
like fate to be bought

or exile you
or enslave you
as justice & freedom sought

shackled feet & concrete
against your theories onslaught

face your foe, david 
or turn and flee, dear lot

and if your honor is concerned
then what the samurai learned
is to notice simply
which way you're turned
when caught

as stoics say 
"come what may!"
bashes and lashes
turned ashes to ashes
or that of salt
pinches & dashes

where will you stand
when upon you the foe crashes
when war chests
have outworn their latches

simple it is not 
i'm afraid to tell
if heaven bound
or bound in hell

for which way points
empty turtle shell?
