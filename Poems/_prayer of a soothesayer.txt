torment me not
i need to know
through and through partched,
my mind find but draught & woe

ignorance bliss
her seeds left to sew
leaves me blank, empty
no words needed to understand "no"

oh! torment me not!
entrentched with desire
grasping at straws silent truth
to be satisfied by flaming pyre

oh, holy ghost
why dost though not speak?

for words are but lies,
and from such i made my retreat
from guile & guise
codexes and councils
all offering up prayers
sins to cancel

are you even listening?
is it worth the hassle?

simple silence as time goes by
petitions left unanswered
