i want to believe,
but i want to stop trying
will believing stop villans from smiling?
what is this?
saviors and miracles told
one lost lamb brought
back to the fold

until it's not

it bled out
in a wolfs mouth

was left to rot

nature has a funny way of playing at god
bursting forth with beauty
while life...
under it's stride is trod
