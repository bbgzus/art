I got wounds that time just won't heal
broken heart, breaks it still that i can't feel
so i pray to the source, god above
give me a shot, infusion of love
the power for mercy when push comes to shove

study'n symbology
with homies that catch bodies
cell sittin talking bout raris
sorry that they caught meglad they didn't shot me
gave me time to rethink all my hobbies

grew up in the age of micheal jordan & tupac
back when famous niggas got shot
skip rope, hop scotch & pop rocks

this isn't all for nothing
or all or nothing
give my all to something
trust god to call ya when you're bluffing
