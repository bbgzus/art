there is a sweetness to sadness
a freedom found in despair
that is there to taste
for anyone that will dare

for is not pain pleasure
meted out in according measure?
and is not trash merely
in another's eye treasure?

so take hold in life's 
cruelest moments
welcome the night
do not try to thwart it

seek ye to find the jewels
that require hardned tools
for sunshine allows the lazy
and abundance the fools

learn this widom now
before you meet the nefilim you must duel
because your strengths can make you weak
but not all pain makes you cruel
