ever heard a roar
that chills you to the core
think of armies off shore
spartans & gore

bested by a soft whimper
that made wrath writher
a golden sympathetic shiver
to sheath arrow in quiver

for what more
use is a roar
plunge spear in boar
feel mighty warrioar

yet the cries that soar
have left me deaf
wishing to never hear anymore
of what war has set in store
or been idolized in ancient lore
