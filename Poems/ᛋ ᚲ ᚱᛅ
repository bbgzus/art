what if i told you a secret?
could you be trusted to divulge
or to keep it?

pearls before swine
truth to an unitiated mind
a fine line
wherewhith fate is intertwined
and with destiny combined

and yet
future foundations may be found
when we rewind to find
truths still sublime
from well before time

what if it couldn't be put into words
silly inventions these nouns and verbs
and even worse
what if it were a curse?
would you still want the secret
for how the world works?

it can all be quite fantasitc
this ancient magic
all in accordance to how he planned it
but be careful with this secret
for god hath damned it
