if you can't beat'em
best to join'em
playin games of switchin frames

teams & tribes
from extortion to bribes
trapped in a system
where all this thrives

so which am i?
an outsider to become?
preferably not the one
destined to be hung
like a pendilum
left then right swung

swayed by power higher, briber
who knows of which the watcher has become
oh this game
i'm stuck inbetween
everyone in masks
real life halloween
