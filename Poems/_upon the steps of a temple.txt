once upon a time
on the steps of a temple

do i believe him?
or up and leave him?
said james, matthew and judas
at the feet of the sanhedrin

oh come on!
thought christ all along
carrying a cross through the streets
that he healed people on

are they really all gone?
alone in despair
wait... i see peter just there
face turned, 3 times
this really isn't fair

thus pulled up then down
to his new found lair
after all, pontius must have thought
he's just another soothesayer

only to be continued... a few thousand years later
