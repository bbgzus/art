am i cursed?
is this punishement?
is it a blessing?
how bad can being wet... get?

sent on both just & unjust
both good and evil will return to dust

what lesson am i too recieve
that i couldn't learn without misery?

who knows why it rains
i only know it doesn't help to complain

so while contemplatin
on percepitation

know that it doesn't change
your situation

so stop hatin
and join the celebratin 

-- 

now i don't know what you've been through
but being bitter aint going to help you
just accept the fact, that is that!
and put your troubles in the rear view

trust in the good lord
a foundation that's been poured
he wasn't sent for peace ya know?
but rather a double edged sword
