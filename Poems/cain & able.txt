why have i turned so dark, so dim
finally giving in
to the wolf that wins

perhaps had i fed
the one that lead
and took him up ahead

instead i lied
to a cage i tied
which made him stronger
the more he tried

so when i visit this grave by the tree
where I burried thee 
i reflect on your end 
and like to pretend 
that my deciet
though it caused your defeat
won't stop you from being a friend
when you live again
and when we meet in eternity
you won't be mad at me
