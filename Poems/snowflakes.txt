excuse me if i come off sad
most dont seem to understand
the life i've had

tragedy
compounded with bad habbitry
felony for using my gadgitry
plus many think im mad ya see
so few take me seriously

oh woe is me, 
tasked with correcting humanity

i've got nothing better to do 
just sit 
correct shit
or ignore it

what does life teach ya?
that man is a social krēCHəa?
me thinks just a convient featCHəa

lets take a lesson from the snow
watch it in the cold
a drop made individuole 
until you hold
and it unfolds*

melt, a better verb:
from a single flake
into one glacier lake
tempted now to use words:

man made symbols*
like synecdoche 
or pars pro toto

frontal lobe
its expandabole
so google that shit
if you don't know
