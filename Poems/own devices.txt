what roams about 
when the lights go out? 
visions of sugar plumbs 
some may say 
yet simply it is not 
what comes out in day 
deep in your gut 
pattern too ancient 
to be cut

nervous sways glances, 
hopes in secard chances 
whispers that seem dismayed 
all say 
"go away" 

with light gowe 
& no hope for dawn 
fear & rage
can when finally play 

confined to shadows 
or a preacher's gallows
they thought it safe to stay 

yet when taken heart 
pull themselves apart

how tragic, 
these self fulfilling 
prophesays
