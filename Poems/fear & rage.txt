what roams about
when the lights go out?

vision of sugarplumbs
some may say
yet simply it is not
what comes out in day

deep in your gut
a pattern too ancient to be cut

nervous glances
hope in second chances

whispers that seem dismayed
all seem to say
"go away"

with light gone
and no hope for dawn
fear & rage
can finally play

confined to shadows
or a preacher's gallows
they thought it safe to stay

yet when taken heart
pull themselves apart
how tragic
these self fulfilling prophesays
