time waits for no man
can feel the weight of it in my hand
through it the sands of time pass can

can't stop it
can't help but to drop it

piles & piles
of the past 
slowly amass
stored away
where no hand can grasp

eternity - 
an absurdity our minds can't fathom at
like tail and tooth at opposite ends of the same kitty cat

unity -
when put under scrutiny
is all just tiny pebbles see

leading to relapse, like old maps,
guiding to a temporal shabbat

so how about we just sit 
allow for a rest
feel the sand and the grit
realize life isn't a test

fancy little tricks
how we shift time with our wits
each moment to decide how it fits 

its...
remarkable
unstoppable
highly improbable
to even be alive like this

- mere breathing
- vicious weeping

each moment an individual gift

upon beach or towel do we stand?
is it strand upon sand?
or sand upon strand?

it really is an acquired taste
to sit, and not judge in haste
this gritty, barren place
so i'll just claim grace
and simply savor 
this salty base

#44 & #51
