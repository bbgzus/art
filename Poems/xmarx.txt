god are you listening?
do you read my journal?

will you be with me in the strip club?
a guest at my funeral?

will you see my deeds?
each temptation tempered?
will you witness my weakness?
my triumphs remember?

is my life entertaining?
or are you tired of my complaining?

sorry for not praising
and hell raising
or not gazing
at all you've made amazing

i'm just learning,
in my own hell burning
so thank you
if indeed you are concerning

for there are moments that feel monumental
others rather instrumental
twisting fate
memories made sentimental

then why does god seem so forgetful?
forgettable?

how many miracles must one witness
to finally
in it's entirety
give in and just 
"get this"
existence

maybe we aren't supposed to 
understand you know who

that anonymity
is a precursor
to being deity

a nameless name
a faceless face 
to save our oh so vain race 

for in losing your life
does one truly gain 
and you'll never get it 
if with words only you try to explain 

it's more than brain
and it's more than heart
but both are very excellent places
for your search of the kingdom 
to start
