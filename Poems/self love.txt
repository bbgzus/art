I'm afraid society tears asunder
the idea of never finding other
of being complete
with out needing to repeat
and involving another in your shiet

Some in order to feel whole
feel they must fill another's hole
when really, ashamed as they may find
could easily be satisfied by one's own mind

free to jump culters, ages, features of all kind
discovering that the fruit outside their own mind's rine
can never trully satisfy

--

for it is easier for sock & lotion
than that which requires motion of the ocean
and that of Helen, which history oft is tellin
was not just beautiful, but was of human life a felon
to cause such a murderous rebellion
1,000 ships so easily sail'n
lives which could have been saved
just to satisfy that which one man craved

that's why i say

if i had to choose
of which to bind to & choose
i'd side with my brain
rather than
same
same
same

for it can change
and has exquisite range
in providing that which you 
refused to do
and found quite strange
