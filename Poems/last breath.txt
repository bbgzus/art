if this, your last breath 
what moments would u regret? 
has fate come too soon? 
never reaching your full bloom 
or mistakes you'd like to forget 

in these or last moments

i hope to inspire 
spend them wisely
not as a liar

not to others of course 
commiting sins of such 
i'm sure you're far to pius
talking about to yourself 
from which you can't hide us

For all of you, 
is hard to realize 
that little voice in ur head 
of which you trivilize 

been taught is wrong all along
from college course to children's song

which is your voice

that oft push away
be that of light or shadow
would both be okay?

in this, your last breath 
what would it say?
