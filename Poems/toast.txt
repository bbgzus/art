tonight i toast
to our heavenly hosts
seraphims & ghosts

right or wrong 
this poem is for both

see imma peacemaker 
a no side taker 
i stand for something greater 
while seeking the creator 
in this earthly theatre 

neither lover or hater
an eternal debater

you can thank me later
for exposing gods'
paradoxical nature

some might call it sacrilege 
doing what budda & jesus did
on the mount of the Lord 
i live on the ridge
i've seen beyond the veil 
hell, it's privilege 

imma vision seer
post atheistic believer
born again new creature 
"seek therefore"
is what I beseech ya 

a beast at then wedding feast?
and i'm like 
"where can i seat ya?" 

cause its two sides
of the same coin 
in a war 
that i won't join 
like pacifist 
who's mad at this 
dualistic shit thats ongoing 

so i want to invite 
you on this special night 
to simply not fight 
be ye black or white 
and exercise the right
to simply not fight

with this 
my toast
