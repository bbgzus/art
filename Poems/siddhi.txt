the reading of thoughts, 
ive never beleved to be true, 
like love potions
or fate you can brew, 

then I had we a taste 
a vision of sorts
only this one was audible, 
it came with a chorus!

although not all the time, 
i'm surprised at what u can find,
if you sneak a peak 
inside of a man's fenzied mind, 
simple fruit rind

Be it grotesques and crass
squishy or coarse
encoded in wrinkles
cyphers and morse

certainly you'd find what causes remorse
so if you'd please be so kind
and pick that moat out of my eye
and help change my course

all sorts of nasty things, 
it threatened and snared 
all for me were prepared. 

not knowing who, what, when to trust
as if into the bowels of hell i was thrust
at first thought kindly 
to those who that made the arrest
thinking saved from all i detest
and could rest

till I couldn't
or was shown I shouldn't 

oh if only I could disapear 
that'd be convienent wouldn't it?
