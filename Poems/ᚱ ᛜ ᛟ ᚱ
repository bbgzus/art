ever heard a roar
that chills you to the core
think of armies off shore
spartans & gore

bested only by a soft whimper
one that makes wrath writher
a golden sympathetic shiver
to sheath arrow in quiver

for what more
use is a roar...
plunge spear in boar
feel mighty warri-or

yet the cries that soar
oft have left me deaf
wishing to never hear anymore
of what war has in store...
or been idolized in ancient lore
