nobody really wants to hear 
what one truly holds in their sphere 
for fear & jealousy are oft reared 
or dispassionate not having it 
it's a bad habit
unless you can rap it 
so let's have it, god damn it!

pearls before swine hurled
possibly to cure 
the ways of this wayward world
this dumpster fire 
that turns honest man liar

for gain
causes pain
& secretly conspire 

to treat the just as rust
a by product like sawdust to combust 
if one must face the gallows 
for revealing their shadows 
in what vulnerability can one trust?
oft that is typically when one simply must 
and into the fire are thrust

if formulated only to appeal
can one be trusted to keep it real?
ashes to ashes 
gashes for gashes 
you know the deal

but i'm christian though! 
well even he died on a hill
an ancient blood oath to fulfill 

multitudes to stand by 
as innocent die 
anumodit ahimsa
you know the why 

silence that can kill 
accompanied with every meal 

nobody really wants to know 
the depth our ego will go 
to hide the sorrow absorbed in tu estomago 
to feed a ferocious fire 
that fuels you head to toe

societies malicious meal fashioned 
not easily abandoned 

wrestling with my own soul 
causing mo gaping holes
where i pray the sacrifices of abraham & christ go 
if not by observance then perhaps by bahkti disciple 

each prayer
another layer 
where self control
could have been 

and how easily 
if it pleases thee, oh diety
to say "no, it isn't so, meat is sin"
shall i reap what i sow?
or mercifully see me forgivn'?

so in that final hour
submitting to the highest power 
i'll ask for compassion from krishna christ 
for all the beings being devoured
