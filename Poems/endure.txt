i want to be done 
satisfied with my race 
a final setting sun 
an ending to embrace 

must i keep trudging? 
waiting, creating & judging? 

it seems as if release absolute 
continues to give me constant nudging 

why am i so reluctant 
to get all i can get? 

did i have to ask
congure the past
things i can't forget

treasures to find
debts come due

a comeback from behind
tragedy too soon

and with every single step
secrets to be made and kept 
so i guess i'll run - til i'm done 
cause i'm not finished yet
