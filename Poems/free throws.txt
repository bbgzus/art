its like missing a free throw
over & over & over

How oft will god forgive? 
miracle outlived

maybe if older
or bolder
or sober
who knows...

yet the dissapoint 
grows & shows
each time u miss
another free throw

"Here ya go!"
its underhand pitch

nevermind your good looks,
freedom, oh & you're rich

still just glances
second hand romances
with each reminded
what a bitch

if only I could switch
events in which i grab the golden snitch

now it's beach bums instead of bikinis
hearses instead of lamborghinis
fruits of hexes and curses
cast against me

she jinx me?
or i myself?

sidetracked
by the pursuit of wealth
misplaced emphasis on stealth
a tendency to leave it on the shelf

ruts of sadness
fringed with madness
oh the mind made fragility!
so i take my leave
drawn now to small towns
where none expect me

recluse 
reject
listless
wanton
easy to forget

whe's birthright sold
for a pot of girls & gold
yet can't seem to accept

sign dotted line
accept! god damn it!

this cruel nature
of sordid behavior
which angels and demons
combat to correct

surely this is the path
of one who has mistept 

the cursed of regret
and secrets kept
