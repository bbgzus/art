there is a pleasure in a pathless wood
harmony upon a lonely shore
where the deep dark ocean dances
the music found in it's roar

its not that i love men less
just nature more and more

there are morsels upon majestic mountain tops
hills upon which to heal
that im afraid words can never portray
nor prescriptions fill
