i heard the spirits
as they threatened and snared
nasty painful things
for me were prepared

not knowing who or when or what to trust
it was as if into hell's bowels i was thrust

At first thought kindly to those that made the arrest
thinking saved from what i detest
and could finally rest

till i couldn't
or rather was shown i shouldn't
if only i could dissapear,
that would be convienient wouldn't it
