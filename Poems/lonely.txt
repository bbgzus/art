just before i off to sleep 
dreaming of nightmares i must repeat 
i consider myself lucky 
no lover to fuck me 
only misery so deep & so sweet 

why oh why must i think of it so? 
because you see i've considered the soul
and in order for one to truly be whole 
one must know what it means to be inconsolable 

so RAGE RAGE RAGE
do not go gentle into that good night
if you must
put up a fuss 
and fight

but as for me? 
i've found darkness to be rather polite
one acquainted with the night
in it finding no fright

oh these dreadful rests
of which the fingers caress
of a lonesome
abandoned boy

who lost is mate
a sick strange fate 

for a poet
such as moi
